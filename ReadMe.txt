Project P3

# Coding Standard
  - Variables and functions will be written in camelCase.
  - Functions will have full names.
  - Variables may be written with abbreviations.
  - Objects and classes are capitalized.
  - Thorough documentation of functionality above the function (commented description with inline comments).
  - Beginning brackets after the element (function, loop etc.) and not on a new line.

# Branch Guidelines
  - Proper names for branches describing what is developed.
  - When editing or adding a function, do not change previous code, unless necessary for the functionality.

# Merge Guidelines
  - All merging to main is done physically; the group will review and understand the code before merging.
  - When parts of the group work on a functionality, they may branch and merge from 2nd branch level without the entire groups consent.

# Testing
  - Unit testing will be performed on the product.
  - Testing will be designed along with the product.
  - Test cases will be available for testing during changes in the development.
